The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in 2019 that approximately 290,000 people died from hepatitis C (mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) can cure more than 95% of individuals with hepatitis C infection, while research on the discovery of new antiviral agents is still ongoing. The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause various biochemical changes in liver cells, and some of these changes are associated with the COX-2 enzyme. The identification of its role in promoting growth in liver cells as well as its involvement in various cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, has made COX-2 an important target in the development of new agents effective against HCV. In this study, thirty-six new 5-arylmethylene-2-imino-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives (5a-s, 6a-s) were synthesized through Knoevenagel condensation of 2-[(4-substitutedpyridin-2-yl)imino]-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives with various aldehydes. Structures of the synthesized compounds were elucidated by the use of spectral and chromatographic techniques, besides elemental analyses. Four compounds were selected for further studies as they were found to suppress the NS5B protein with anti-HCV activity using the Western Blotting method. The selected compounds 5o, 6m, 6r, and 6s inhibited HCV with EC50 values of 8.0 ± 0.2 µM, 13.9 ± 0.45, 9.2 ± 0.2 µM, and 12.1 ± 0.1 µM, respectively. It was determined that these compounds reduced HCV-induced COX-2 promoter activity in Ava5 cells compared to Huh7 cells. The antiviral effects of the compounds were also investigated on DENV, closely related to HCV due to sharing certain biological, structural, and mechanical properties throughout their life cycles. However, no significant effect was observed in the preliminary screening study, indicating the compounds' specificity for HCV. Considering the relationship between HCV, DENV, and COX-2, the compounds' COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition potentials were investigated both in vitro and in silico. Compounds 6d, 6e, 6f, and 6m, which exhibited high selective COX-2 inhibition, were discussed for their interactions with the active site. Our study revealed that our target compounds suppressed COX-2 both at the protein level and through enzyme inhibition, thus providing promising findings for the discovery of new anti-HCV effective COX-2 inhibitors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Marmara Üniversitesi, (SAG-C-DRP-050614-0227); Marmara Üniversitesi; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST111-2311-B-110-001); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (2211-C); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191714624

No DENV antiviral drugs have been approved, yet they are desperately needed. The current study focuses on finding potential therapeutics from 8 medicinal plants reported to have activity against the DENV NS2B/NS3 protease in vitro. Eighty-two phytocompounds were selected from eight different medicinal plants like Vernonia cinerea, Tridax procumbens, Cassia angustifolia, Lawsonia inermis, Dryobalanops aromatic, Punica granatum, Zingiber zerumbet and Zizyphus-jujuba. The top five phytocompounds (Epicatechin (EPI), Chrysoeriol (CHR), Apigenin (API), Quercetin-3,4′-Dimethylether (QUE), and Caffeic acid (CAF)) identified from toxicity evaluation and docking studies were further subjected to 100 ns long Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to study their structural stability and binding affinity through MM-PBSA based free-energy calculations. MD results revealed overall conformational stability with all the five phytocompounds. Furthermore, MM-PBSA results suggest binding free energy values of −154.415 kJ/mol, −151.154 kJ/mol, −139.048 kJ/mol, −122.827 kJ/mol), and −120.622 kJ/mol for compound EPI, QUE, API, CAF, and CHR respectively by interacting with essential binding site residues. These compounds could thus be studied extensively to develop nature-based therapeutic compounds as anti-dengue agents for DENV2. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Department of Higher Education, India; Berhampur University, BAMU; World Bank-OHEPEE; Science & Technology (S & T, (SCST-MISC-0061-2018-1288); University Grants Commission, UGC, (F.30-484/2019(BSR))",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188171372
