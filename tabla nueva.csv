The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in 2019 that approximately 290,000 people died from hepatitis C (mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) can cure more than 95% of individuals with hepatitis C infection, while research on the discovery of new antiviral agents is still ongoing. The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause various biochemical changes in liver cells, and some of these changes are associated with the COX-2 enzyme. The identification of its role in promoting growth in liver cells as well as its involvement in various cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, has made COX-2 an important target in the development of new agents effective against HCV. In this study, thirty-six new 5-arylmethylene-2-imino-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives (5a-s, 6a-s) were synthesized through Knoevenagel condensation of 2-[(4-substitutedpyridin-2-yl)imino]-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives with various aldehydes. Structures of the synthesized compounds were elucidated by the use of spectral and chromatographic techniques, besides elemental analyses. Four compounds were selected for further studies as they were found to suppress the NS5B protein with anti-HCV activity using the Western Blotting method. The selected compounds 5o, 6m, 6r, and 6s inhibited HCV with EC50 values of 8.0 ± 0.2 µM, 13.9 ± 0.45, 9.2 ± 0.2 µM, and 12.1 ± 0.1 µM, respectively. It was determined that these compounds reduced HCV-induced COX-2 promoter activity in Ava5 cells compared to Huh7 cells. The antiviral effects of the compounds were also investigated on DENV, closely related to HCV due to sharing certain biological, structural, and mechanical properties throughout their life cycles. However, no significant effect was observed in the preliminary screening study, indicating the compounds' specificity for HCV. Considering the relationship between HCV, DENV, and COX-2, the compounds' COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition potentials were investigated both in vitro and in silico. Compounds 6d, 6e, 6f, and 6m, which exhibited high selective COX-2 inhibition, were discussed for their interactions with the active site. Our study revealed that our target compounds suppressed COX-2 both at the protein level and through enzyme inhibition, thus providing promising findings for the discovery of new anti-HCV effective COX-2 inhibitors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Marmara Üniversitesi, (SAG-C-DRP-050614-0227); Marmara Üniversitesi; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST111-2311-B-110-001); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (2211-C); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191714624

No DENV antiviral drugs have been approved, yet they are desperately needed. The current study focuses on finding potential therapeutics from 8 medicinal plants reported to have activity against the DENV NS2B/NS3 protease in vitro. Eighty-two phytocompounds were selected from eight different medicinal plants like Vernonia cinerea, Tridax procumbens, Cassia angustifolia, Lawsonia inermis, Dryobalanops aromatic, Punica granatum, Zingiber zerumbet and Zizyphus-jujuba. The top five phytocompounds (Epicatechin (EPI), Chrysoeriol (CHR), Apigenin (API), Quercetin-3,4′-Dimethylether (QUE), and Caffeic acid (CAF)) identified from toxicity evaluation and docking studies were further subjected to 100 ns long Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to study their structural stability and binding affinity through MM-PBSA based free-energy calculations. MD results revealed overall conformational stability with all the five phytocompounds. Furthermore, MM-PBSA results suggest binding free energy values of −154.415 kJ/mol, −151.154 kJ/mol, −139.048 kJ/mol, −122.827 kJ/mol), and −120.622 kJ/mol for compound EPI, QUE, API, CAF, and CHR respectively by interacting with essential binding site residues. These compounds could thus be studied extensively to develop nature-based therapeutic compounds as anti-dengue agents for DENV2. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Department of Higher Education, India; Berhampur University, BAMU; World Bank-OHEPEE; Science & Technology (S & T, (SCST-MISC-0061-2018-1288); University Grants Commission, UGC, (F.30-484/2019(BSR))",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188171372

Due to their low substrate specificity, PP1’s catalytic subunits do not exist as free entities but instead bind to Regulatory Interactors of Protein Phosphatase One (RIPPO), which regulate PP1’s substrate specificity and subcellular localization. Most RIPPOs bind to PP1 through combinations of short linear motifs (4–12 residues), forming highly specific PP1 holoenzymes. These PP1-binding motifs may, hence, represent attractive targets for the development of specific drugs that interfere with a subset of PP1 holoenzymes. Several viruses exploit the host cell protein (de)phosphorylation machinery to ensure efficient virus particle formation and propagation. While the role of many host cell kinases in viral life cycles has been extensively studied, the targeting of phosphatases by viral proteins has been studied in less detail. Here, we compile and review what is known concerning the role of PP1 in the context of viral infections and discuss how it may constitute a putative host-based target for the development of novel antiviral strategies. © 2024, The Author(s).","Institute for Biomedicine—iBiMED, (2020.10111, CEECIND/03747/2017, UIDB/04501/2020); QREN; European Commission, EC; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (2020.10111.BD); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES; Horizon 2020, (H2020-WIDESPREAD-2020-5 ID-952373); Horizon 2020; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85182979918

The purpose of this review is to highlight the enormous potential of digital transformation tools in managing and mitigating neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which affect millions of people worldwide, particularly in the Global South. To meet this purpose, we conducted a scoping review of existing literature and investigated the specific application of these technologies to NTDs. Briefly, the review entailed three main components: a bibliometric analysis, a content analysis, and the design of an ontological model to illustrate the relationships between technologies and diseases. Recent Findings: The review highlights the emerging use of smartphones as a promising tool not only to increase communication and awareness on NTDs but also to enhance the possibilities of their management. The findings also underscore the use of artificial intelligence in the development of new drugs, as well as the application of deep learning in predicting and detecting diseases and vectors. Content analysis stated the main NTDs in literature addressed by when associated to the use of digital health like dengue and malaria. From this review, an ontological model was developed to link diseases and digital tools used to combat NTDs in the Global South. These findings suggest that a new and growing field of research and application that utilises digital technology to address the challenges posed by NTDs. Summary: The present scoping review identifies the significant potential of digital technologies in the fight against NTDs. Important barriers such as sustainable financing, data privacy, and the need for capacity building are recognised. A novel aspect of this review is the design of an ontological model to serve as a guide to new technological products applied to solve issues related to NTDs. The model connects concepts and major results found in the literature, indicating a structured approach to understanding and applying digital transformation in combating NTDs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","COPPE-UFRJ; Vassouras University; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences, NIHSS, (BRI22/1215); National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences, NIHSS",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189918575

Thus, the objective of this work is to identify molecules extracted from the plant Clitoria fairchildiana that are potentially active against dengue viruses (DENV) enabling the development of a new therapeutic system made possible through an in silico model. The methodological strategy was based on molecular docking that aims the prediction of interaction characteristics between chemical compounds (ligands) and their macromolecular targets when the structures of both (ligand and receptor) considering as validation parameters: calculations of RMSD-Root Mean Square Deviation, the free energy of binding and biochemical interactions formed between the complexes.

DENV is the causative agent of dengue, the most rapidly spreading viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Each year, millions of people contract the virus through bites from infected female mosquitoes of the Aedes species. In the majority of individuals, the infection is asymptomatic, and the immune system successfully manages to control virus replication within a few days. Symptomatic individuals may present with a mild fever (Dengue fever or DF) that may or may not progress to a more critical disease termed Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or the fatal Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In the absence of a universally accepted prophylactic vaccine or therapeutic drug, treatment is mostly restricted to supportive measures. Similar to many other viruses that induce acute illness, DENV has developed several ways to modulate host metabolism to create an environment conducive to genome replication and the dissemination of viral progeny. To search for new therapeutic options, understanding the underlying host-virus regulatory system involved in various biological processes of the viral life cycle is essential. This review aims to summarize the complex interaction between DENV and the host cellular machinery, comprising regulatory mechanisms at various molecular levels such as epigenetic modulation of the host genome, transcription of host genes, translation of viral and host mRNAs, post-transcriptional regulation of the host transcriptome, post-translational regulation of viral proteins, and pathways involved in protein degradation. © The Author(s) 2024.","All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, AIIMS; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DBT; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB",Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190882359
